Project Start: Market Prediction Application

The provided script is the backend foundation of a market prediction application. Its current implementation focuses on:
1.Simulating Data: Generating 100 days of market price data with a simple linear trend and some noise.
2.Building a Predictive Model: Using linear regression to predict future market prices based on the simulated historical data.
3. Evaluation and Visualization: Calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model's accuracy and visualizing the predicted vs. actual data trends.
4. Future Predictions**: Forecasting market prices for the next 20 days based on the model.

Current Limitations
1. No Real Data Integration: The model relies on simulated data, limiting its applicability to real-world market scenarios.
2. Backend-Only: The application lacks a user interface (UI) to make it user-friendly.
3. Limited Features:
   - Only predicts based on a single feature (`Day`), without considering other market indicators like volume, sentiment, or macroeconomic trends.
   - No interactivity, insights, or user-configurable options.

How We Will Improve It

 1. UI/UX Enhancements
   - Web Interface: Develop a simple web-based UI using Django for backend integration and React.js for frontend.
   - Interactive Visualizations: Replace static plots with dynamic visualizations using libraries like Plotly allowing users to explore data trends interactively.
   - User Input Options:
     - Upload custom datasets (e.g., CSV files with historical prices).
     - Adjust prediction parameters, such as the number of future days.
2. Integration with Real Market Data
   - APIs: Fetch live market data using APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl to replace simulated data.
   - Preprocessing: Automate data cleaning and feature extraction pipelines to handle real-world data more effectively.
